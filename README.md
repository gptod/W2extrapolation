# Extrapolation in the Wasserstein space

Computation of the extrapolation according to the quadratic Wasserstein distance between two probability measures discretized as point clouds. The code is an implementation of the algorithm cointained in:

[1] GallouÃ«t, T. O., Natale, A., & Todeschi, G. (2025). [_Metric extrapolation in the Wasserstein space_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10516). Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations, 64(5), 147.

The algorithm is implemented in fortran and wrapped into a python module using f2py, for simplicity of use.

## Contents of the repository

The repository contain:
1. The fortran source code containing the implementation of the algorithm and the necessary subroutines: global.f90 and w2extrapolation.f90
2. The python wrapper for the fortran code: w2extrapolation.cpython-312-darwin.so
3. The python interface function: extra_py.py
4. The python code to reproduce the main test from [1]: test_extra_n.py and plot_extra_n.py
5. The data to reproduce the abovementioned test: measures (with a smaller version for test measures_small)

The source global.f90 is only used to define the global precision for w2extrapolation.f90, single (for faster computation) or double. This can be easily changed but require then to recompile the fortran source code via the following command (requires installation of [f2py](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/))

f2py --fcompiler=gfortran -c global.f90 w2extrapolation.f90 -m w2extrapolation
